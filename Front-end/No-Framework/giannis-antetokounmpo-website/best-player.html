          <p>&emsp;According to professional NBA analyst PrestF, the second best player to have ever touched a basketball, Giannis is the best player ever - and he's absolutely undoubtedly correct.</p>
          
          <br>
          <p>&emsp;In the 2019-2020 season PrestF is currently averaging 31.1 points, 15 rebounds, and 69 assists. He is one of the nations top voted and best analysts, normally basing his opinions on statistics and math. "Giannis is the best player ever because he is just simply the best", PrestF said in an ESPN interview when asked the question, "Why do you think Giannis is the best player?"</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            &emsp;In NBA history, usually choosing the best player or the "MVP" is usually a very controversial topic, but in the last 8 years it hasn't. Why? Because of the 2-Time All-Star Game starter, multiple MVP winner Giannis Antetounmpo. No one in this entire world denies the absolute fact that Giannis Antetokounmpo is the best player.</p>
          <br>
          <p>&emsp;Even my man Russell Westbrook came out to me after my 15 point game and said "You shouldn't even compete against Giannis, you're nowhere near his skill." That's when I knew I had to come out clean.</p>
          <br>
          
          <p>&emsp;Don't get me wrong I personally believe I'm a decent player, but in no way match the level of skill Giannis possesses. My stepbacks and tricks are repetitive but somehow sometimes work. However, being the best player in the league, they always works for Giannis.</p>
          <br>
          <p>&emsp;I simply apologize for contesting and making it seem like I deserved MVP. I really don't. I was honestly just jealous that I couldn't be like Giannis. I wanted to be like him. For all my Rocketeers out there I am sorry and wish to continue from this misunderstandment and mistake.</p>
          <br>
          <p id="last">Sincerely, James Harden</p>
