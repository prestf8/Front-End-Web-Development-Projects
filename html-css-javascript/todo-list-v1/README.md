# Todo-List-v1
Version 1 of a pretty simple and crappy todo list. Doesn't save your "todos" and theres barely any functionality.

### Created September 25, 2020

### Version 1
- Little Functionality
- Works
- Messy Javascript
- Didn't know how to use LocalStorage property to store DOM elements so I didn't successfully implement it
- Basic outline of what's to come...
- Delete button to delete todos
- Clear All Button for clearing your todos
- **VERY** Responsive :)
- **Doesn't save your todos on reload/exiting window**


### Possible Ideas in the future for Todo List
- **DOES** save your todos upon reloading/exiting window
- Clear All Button sends warning for your confirmation
- Edit Button to edit todo
- Change clock look cause it looks ugly
- Settings tab in Header top right to adjust settings
- Progress display that displays your progress
- Overall better looking todo list
- Next time I build todo list it'll probably be in React/Typescript or both
- Make code look better
